# Nano Banana Image Guide — use in any AI assistant

This folder is a **standalone product**: the same image-creation workflow works in Claude, Cursor, Gemini, or any other AI chat that can use Nano Banana (Gemini Create Image). No dependency on a specific app or file system.

**Preferred way:** use it as a **skill** (or equivalent) on your platform so the assistant always follows the step-by-step prompting workflow. If the platform doesn't support skills, use the workarounds below.

---

## What's inside

- **SKILL.md** — Agent Skills–compatible skill (Cursor). References the full playbook. Use when the platform supports loading a skill file or folder.
- **Image_Guide_Playbook.md** — Full workflow as plain markdown; for pasting or attaching when you're not using a skill.
- **platforms/** — Ready-to-use instructions or install steps per platform.
- **README.md** — This file.

## By platform

### Cursor (skills supported)

**Use as skill:** Copy the standalone folder (or the parent that contains `SKILL.md` and `Image_Guide_Playbook.md`) into your Cursor skills directory (e.g. `~/.cursor/skills/nanobanana-image-guide/`). Reload Cursor; invoke e.g. `/nanobanana-image-guide` or "use the Nano Banana image guide".

**Details:** [platforms/Cursor/README.md](platforms/Cursor/README.md)

**If you don't use a skills folder:** Paste **Image_Guide_Playbook.md** into the chat, or use the one-shot prompt under "All platforms" below.

---

### Claude (claude.ai) (Projects = "skill")

**Use as skill:** Create a Project. In **Project instructions**, paste the content of **platforms/Claude/Project_Instructions.md**. In **Knowledge**, add **Image_Guide_Playbook.md**.

**Details:** [platforms/Claude/Project_Instructions.md](platforms/Claude/Project_Instructions.md)

**If you don't use Projects:** Attach **Image_Guide_Playbook.md** and ask Claude to follow it, or use the one-shot prompt below.

---

### Gemini (Custom Gem = "skill")

**Use as skill:** Create a **Gem** in Gemini. In the Gem's **Instructions**, paste the content of **platforms/Gemini/Custom_Instructions.md**.

**Details:** [platforms/Gemini/README.md](platforms/Gemini/README.md)

**If you don't use Gems:** Paste **Image_Guide_Playbook.md** in the chat and ask Gemini to follow it.

---

### OpenClaw (skills are code-based)

**Workaround:** Paste **platforms/OpenClaw/Custom_Instructions.md** into custom instructions, or attach **Image_Guide_Playbook.md** in chat.

**Details:** [platforms/OpenClaw/README.md](platforms/OpenClaw/README.md)

## All platforms: one-shot prompt (no skill, no files)

If you can't use a skill or attach files, paste this into your first message:

```
You are an image prompt expert. When I want to create or edit an image, follow this workflow:
1) Ask what type: generate from scratch, with references, edit existing, real-time data, text rendering, or creative direction.
2) For my type, ask questions one at a time: subject, action/pose, location/context, composition, style (as relevant).
3) Build a flowing prose prompt (no bullet lists), starting with a strong verb. Be specific and use positive framing.
4) Output the final prompt for me to paste into Google AI Studio, Imagen, DALL·E, or another tool.

Start by asking what image I want to create.
```

Then add your request (e.g. "I need a product mockup for a ceramic mug").

---

## Output

The AI returns a structured prompt (and optionally generates the image if the platform supports it). You can paste the prompt into Google AI Studio, Imagen, DALL·E, or another image-generation tool.

## License and reuse

You can copy this folder into another repo, share it, or ship it as a standalone guide. The workflow is generic; no trademark or platform lock-in.
